# Tic-Tac-Toe (React)
This is tic-tac-toe built within React. It allows two players to edit their names and play the game.

I learned this while studying a React course online.

The original was built by [Academind](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/) on Udemy.

The full course is great and can be purchased at [React - The complete guide 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

**instructions:**

npm -i

npm run dev
